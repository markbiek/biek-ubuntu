This is a Docker image (borrowed heavily from https://github.com/tutumcloud/lamp) with:

* Apache2
* MySQL
* PHP 7
* NodeJS
* Composer
* Laravel 5.3
* An example Laravel website

We also include a `Dockerrun.aws.json` so containers can be deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

I needed a better way to handle local web development _and_ I wanted to learn more about Docker so this serves both purposes.

Latest image build can be found on Dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/r/baldibiek/biek-ubuntu/)
